# Oh My CPA domain context

Oh My CPA adds a user-owned identity and organization layer above CLIProxyAPI (CPA). CPA remains the execution and protocol-adaptation backend; Oh My CPA stores the business meaning users give to CPA resources.

## Terms

- **Source**: The service origin a user recognizes, such as OpenAI, OpenCode Go, Command Code GOAT, DeepSeek, or a relay station. It is not the same as CPA's technical provider field.
- **Subscription**: A purchased plan or entitlement associated with a Source. One subscription may have multiple accounts or credentials.
- **Account**: A user or upstream identity associated with a Source or Subscription. A local account ID is stable even if an upstream email or identifier changes.
- **Credential**: Authentication material that CPA can use, such as an OAuth auth file, API key, service account, or runtime-only credential. Oh My CPA references and describes credentials; it does not expose secrets in normal resource responses.
- **Endpoint**: A network destination, represented by a base URL and related connection details. An Endpoint is where traffic goes, not necessarily who provides the service.
- **Connection**: A user-facing usable line formed from a Source, optional Subscription and Account, Credential, Endpoint, and Protocol Driver. It is the primary resource users organize and name.
- **Protocol Driver**: The technical protocol adapter used by CPA, such as Codex/Responses, OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, or Gemini. It is implementation metadata, not the user-facing Source.
- **CPA Binding**: The link between a Connection and a concrete resource on one CPA instance, including the CPA resource type and runtime auth index.
- **Unclaimed Resource**: A CPA resource discovered by Oh My CPA that has no confirmed local user identity or override yet. It is presented in the triage queue for naming and organization.

## Naming rule

User-facing names, icons, colors, ownership, and subscription metadata belong to Oh My CPA. CPA driver names, auth indexes, base URLs, and raw provider fields remain technical details and are shown secondarily.
