# Oh My CPA architecture

Module map, data flows, and the invariants that hold them together. Domain
vocabulary lives in `CONTEXT.md`; visual rules live in `docs/design.md`; the
decisions behind the shape below are recorded in `docs/adr/`.

## 1. Runtime shape

```text
browser ──▶ reverse proxy or Vite ──▶ Go process (one binary)
                                        ├─ chi router under the base path
                                        ├─ embedded React SPA (internal/web/dist)
                                        ├─ SQLite (WAL, one connection)
                                        ├─ usage collector  ──▶ CPA
                                        └─ pricing sync loop ──▶ models.dev

Go process ──▶ CPA management API (/v0/management) ──▶ upstream providers
Go process ──▶ CPA RESP usage channel
```

One process, one SQLite file, one Oh My CPA replica. The Go process owns the
base path contract: the SPA is served at `<base>/`, the API at `<base>/api/v1`,
media at `<base>/media`. The proxy must preserve the prefix rather than strip
it (ADR 0001).

The React bundle is built into `internal/web/dist` and embedded with
`go:embed`, so a deployment has no CDN or static-file dependency. Everything the
browser can reach is a handwritten JSON endpoint; there is no generic pass
through to CPA.

## 2. Go package map

Dependency direction is acyclic at package level. `internal/usage` (payload
decoding) and `internal/usage/ingest` (the capture loop) are separate packages,
so `repository → usage` and `usage/ingest → repository` do not form an import
cycle even though the `internal/usage` directory appears in both directions.

| Package | Responsibility | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/config` | Environment parsing and defaults; `.env` loading | — |
| `internal/domain` | Durable entities (`CPAInstance`, resources) | — |
| `internal/crypto` | AES-GCM envelope for secrets at rest | — |
| `internal/security` | Redaction, keyed-HMAC fingerprints, display masks | — |
| `internal/auth` | Admin session cookie: sign, verify, rotate | — |
| `internal/usage` | Decode CPA usage/error payloads into typed events | `security` |
| `internal/usage/resp` | Minimal RESP client for CPA's subscribe/LPOP subset | — |
| `internal/pricing` | Catalog snapshot, model matching, sync service, money math | — |
| `internal/cpa/management` | Typed CPA `/v0/management` client and RESP stream wrapper | `internal/usage/resp` |
| `internal/cpa/discovery` | Normalize CPA resources into the local identity model | `management`, `crypto`, `domain`, `security` |
| `internal/cpa/configyaml` | YAML document editing that preserves comments and unknown keys | — |
| `internal/repository` | SQLite schema, migrations, queries, transactional invariants | `crypto`, `domain`, `pricing`, `security`, `usage` |
| `internal/usage/ingest` | Collector loop, decode processor, rollup and retention maintenance | `repository`, `management`, `security`, `usage` |
| `internal/quota` | Per-provider quota probes and normalization | `management` |
| `internal/api` | Routes, DTO allowlists, secret-reveal grants, audit writes | all of the above, `internal/web` |
| `internal/web` | `go:embed` of the built SPA | — |
| `internal/app` | Wiring, background loops, graceful shutdown | all of the above |

Two rules keep the boundary meaningful:

- `internal/repository` owns transaction boundaries. Anything that must be
  atomic with a write (cost locking, inbox→event promotion, rollup checkpoints)
  is a repository method, not a sequence of calls from a service.
- `internal/api` owns the allowlist. A new response field is a deliberate DTO
  change; the allowlist tests fail otherwise.

## 3. Frontend shape

`web/src` is a single-page app on React + TypeScript + Ant Design, with TanStack
Query for server state.

| Area | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `App.tsx` | Router, lazily loaded pages, theme and locale providers |
| `api/client.ts` | The one typed HTTP client; every endpoint is declared here |
| `types/` | Wire types, including `usageEventView.ts` (row projection and filters) |
| `hooks/` | `usePreference`, `useLogTail`, `useVisibleNow` |
| `i18n/index.tsx` | The `[zh, en]` dictionary and the `t()` context |
| `theme/` | `themeConfig.ts` (antd tokens), `cacheScale.ts` (OKLCH cache ramp) |
| `components/`, `pages/` | Feature UI; one page per route, no page owns another |

All page routes are `React.lazy` import boundaries so the entry chunk stays
small; the shell (`AppLayout`, `AuthGate`) is loaded eagerly because every
route needs it. `components/resources/` and `components/icons/PresetIcon.tsx`
are retained from the retired triage console and are currently unreferenced; the
backend discovery/binding model they rendered is still live behind Providers and
Auth Files.

CSS class names are kebab-case everywhere, including `*.module.css` exports,
which are consumed as `styles['kebab-case']`. That is not cosmetic: `tsc` types a
CSS module as `Record<string, string>`, so a stale class reference compiles and
fails silently at runtime. `pnpm check-css-modules` is the guard that closes
that hole.

## 4. Request and session flow

1. `POST <base>/api/auth/login` with the CPA management key. The handler
   compares it against `OMCPA_CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`; there is no second password.
2. On success the session manager derives an HMAC key from the management key
   and issues an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie (`Secure` when
   `OMCPA_PUBLIC_URL` is HTTPS) with a 12-hour expiry.
3. `requireAuthentication` wraps every `/api/v1` route and rejects an absent or
   stale cookie with 401.
4. Rotating the CPA management key changes the derived signing key, so every
   existing session fails verification without any server-side session store.
5. Sensitive exports (raw auth file, raw config YAML, request logs) require an
   additional short-lived reveal grant and write an `audit_events` row;
   audit-write failure blocks the export (fail closed).

The key itself is encrypted with `OMCPA_MASTER_KEY` and stored on the
`cpa_instances` row, where `bootstrapDefaultInstance` refreshes it at every
startup so a rotation needs no SQLite surgery.

## 5. Discovery and identity flow

```text
POST /api/v1/instances/default/discover
  → internal/cpa/management reads auth-files, codex/claude/gemini API keys,
    openai-compatibility entries
  → cpa/discovery derives a stable resource key and binding fingerprint
  → repository upserts discovered_resources + cpa_bindings
  → Providers / Auth Files pages read the projected rows
```

The resource key resolution order and the ban on array position are fixed by
ADR 0002: immutable upstream id, then family-scoped `auth_index`, then a
versioned keyed HMAC of the credential material, then a fingerprint of
non-sensitive metadata, and finally an explicit `identity_collision` marker
rather than a silent merge. Secrets never enter a key, a fingerprint input that
is stored, or a response DTO.

`cpa_bindings` carries `missing_at_ms` and `ON DELETE SET NULL` so upstream
removal marks a binding missing without cascading into history.

## 6. Usage flow

```text
CPA queue / subscription
  → ingest.Runner        pop or receive, persist immediately
  → usage_inboxes        raw payload, status pending, durable before decoding
  → ingest.Processor     decode via internal/usage, dedupe on event_key
  → usage_events         typed row + request-time price snapshot (one tx)
  → ingest.Maintenance   incremental rollup into hourly/daily stats,
                         retention purge
  → /management/dashboard, /management/dashboard/tail, /usage/events
```

The pipeline exists because CPA's queue is destructive and short-lived: the only
safe ordering is "persist the raw payload first, interpret it later". A failed
local write records an `ingest_gaps` row so coverage loss is visible instead of
silent, and `usage_inboxes.status` (`pending → processed | failed | discarded`)
makes a decode failure retryable without losing telemetry.

`internal/usage/ingest.Runner` picks its transport in `auto` mode by probing
`AUTH` only — never by popping, because a probe that consumed a record would
destroy it. Subscription is preferred; repeated `SUBSCRIBE` failures degrade to
RESP `LPOP`, and an unreachable RESP endpoint degrades to HTTP
`/v0/management/usage-queue`. Empty pulls back off through `pullPacer` (1s → 2s →
4s → 8s → 10s, then capped) while a full batch drains with no delay. A wrong
management key triggers a long cooldown instead of retrying, because CPA bans a
client IP after repeated failures.

Timestamps in the usage tables are epoch **milliseconds**; the older identity
tables use `unixepoch()` seconds. Rollups are gated by
`usage_aggregation_checkpoints` so aggregation is incremental rather than a
full rescan.

### Why the request list is ordered by `id`, not `timestamp_ms`

`timestamp_ms` is when the request *started*. An agent request can run for
minutes, so a row written to `usage_events` just now can carry a timestamp older
than requests that started after it. Ordering the request list by timestamp
therefore buries the newest row in the middle of the list, and a live view looks
frozen while records are arriving. `ListUsageEvents` orders by `id` — recording
order — so the collector's latest write is always the first row, and the keyset
cursor is a single `id < ?` predicate.

That order needs its own index. Without `idx_usage_events_instance_id`
(migration 021) SQLite satisfies the instance/time filter from
`idx_usage_events_instance_time` and then sorts every matching row in a temp
B-tree: measured against 200k rows, `LIMIT 101` cost **22 ms** instead of
**0.1 ms**. The index is `(instance_id, id DESC)`, and because `id` is the rowid
alias it also serves the cursor seek.

Request *time* remains the windowing key (`timestamp_ms >= from AND <= to`) and
the axis of every rollup and chart. Users compare rows against the timestamps
printed on them, so the two orderings are allowed to disagree — which is why the
page states the order next to the window instead of silently re-sorting rows the
reader can see are out of time order.

## 7. Pricing flow

The catalog, the editable current price, and the immutable version history are
three separate things (ADR 0003):

```text
CPA catalog read ──▶ pricing_model_catalog   (last complete snapshot)
                          │
models.dev api.json ──▶ pricing.Service ──▶ model_prices      (current projection)
                          │                      │ triggers
                          │                      ▼
                          │              model_price_versions (immutable, time-effective)
                          ▼
                    manual rows win; a delete writes an unavailable tombstone
```

`usage_events` stores the price version id and integer USD nanos chosen in the
event's own insert transaction, using the request timestamp. Historical totals
never join the mutable `model_prices` table, so a later edit cannot rewrite an
invoice. A request with no effective version is stored with pricing status
`unpriced` (`legacy_unpriced` for rows that predate migration 019), cost absent,
and is never backfilled.

Matching (`internal/pricing/match.go`) ranks catalog candidates with a fixed
tie-break chain instead of refusing ambiguous ones; an entry without explicit
input/output rates is never selected, because a missing rate must not become
zero.

## 8. Quota flow

`internal/quota` calls CPA's `/api-call` with the credential under observation to
reach the provider's own usage endpoint. Targets are restricted to
`AllowedURLPrefixes` — a compile-time allowlist of official HTTPS endpoints — and
the resulting snapshot is normalized and stored in `quota_snapshots`. This is the
only place Oh My CPA uses CPA as a request proxy, and it is server-initiated:
there is no user-supplied URL or generic `/api-call` surface.

## 9. Storage

| Table group | Tables | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instances & identity | `cpa_instances`, `discovered_resources`, `resource_overrides`, `connections`, `cpa_bindings` | Encrypted management key; bindings survive upstream removal. `connections` is provisioned by migration 006 for the Connection entity but no code reads or writes it yet — treat it as reserved, not as a live table |
| Usage | `usage_inboxes`, `usage_events`, `error_events`, `ingest_gaps`, `usage_overview_hourly_stats`, `usage_overview_daily_stats`, `usage_aggregation_checkpoints` | Milliseconds; raw payloads encrypted |
| Pricing | `model_prices`, `model_price_versions`, `pricing_sync_state`, `pricing_model_catalog`, `pricing_catalog_state` | Versions are append-only via triggers |
| Operations | `audit_events`, `ui_preferences`, `quota_snapshots`, `schema_migrations` | Audit has no update or delete path — only `RecordAuditEvent` writes and read queries exist, and export itself is audited; the schema carries no enforcement trigger, so the guarantee lives in the repository API |

Migrations are embedded from `migrations/` and applied in filename order inside
one transaction each. A migration against an existing on-disk database first
writes an AES-GCM backup plus SHA-256 sidecar, restores it as a smoke test, and
keeps the newest five. Migration 004 additionally runs a Go governance hook
inside its transaction to sanitize historical rows. Rollback is forward-only:
fix a defect with a new migration, never by editing `schema_migrations`
(`docs/ops/sqlite-operations.md`).

## 10. Background loops

| Loop | Owner | Failure behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP server | `app.Run` | Fatal; shutdown drains 10s |
| Usage pipeline | `app.Run` → `ingest.Pipeline` | Fatal; a stopped collector must not serve silently stale numbers |
| Pricing sync | `app.Run` → `pricing.Service` | Best effort; prices go stale, capture continues |
| Rollup + retention | `ingest.Maintenance` inside the pipeline | Retried on its own interval; errors surface in ingest status |
